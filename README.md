# Connect Four Game
## Author: Klaudia Jaros

### Description:

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs

My implementation of Connect Four uses a Text User Interface on a command line and it is written in C language using standard libraries. 

### Requirements:

C Compiler - I used Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt for Windows OS

### How to install:

Open your Developer Command Prompt/C Compiler and use the command: nmake game , to compile the application and produce connectFour.exe. You are ready to use the application now.

### How to delete:

Open your Developer Command Prompt/C Compiler and use the command: nmake clear
