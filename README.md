# Connect Four Game
## Author: Klaudia Jaros

### Description:

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a colour and then take turns dropping coloured discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs

My implementation of Connect Four uses a Text User Interface on a command line and it is written in C language using standard libraries.
